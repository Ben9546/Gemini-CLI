Here are all the remote branches in your git repository:

- origin/HEAD -> origin/main
- origin/Issue-3161
- origin/main

Let me know if you need to perform any actions with these branches!

You have successfully checked out the remote branch origin/Issue-3161. You are now in a "detached HEAD" state, which means you are not on a local branch, but rather viewing the state of the repository at the commit pointed to by that remote branch.

If you want to make changes and keep them, you should create a new local branch from here. You can do this with:

```
git switch -c <new-branch-name>
```

Replace <new-branch-name> with your desired branch name.

Let me know if you want to create a local branch or need help with anything else!
