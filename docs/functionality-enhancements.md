# Functionality Enhancements

This document outlines the new functionality enhancements for the Gemini CLI.

## Sub-agent functionality

- **Description:** Allow creating sub-agents for specific tasks with their own context and tool access.
- **Implementation:** Extend the agent framework to support nested agents with isolated contexts. Add CLI commands to spawn and manage sub-agents.

## Custom toolsets

- **Description:** Enable users to define custom toolsets for specific workflows (e.g., 'code review' toolset).
- **Implementation:** Add a configuration file to define toolsets as JSON objects. Allow CLI flags to select toolsets.

## Multi-file operations

- **Description:** Support handling multiple files or directories in a single command.
- **Implementation:** Modify read/write tools to accept glob patterns or directory paths. Process files in a loop.

## Partial file reading

- **Description:** Enable reading specific lines or sections of a file without loading the entire file.
- **Implementation:** Add options like `--lines 10-20` or `--section 'function main'` to the read tool.

## File format parsing

- **Description:** Automatically parse common file formats (e.g., JSON, YAML) for structured output.
- **Implementation:** Integrate libraries like `json` and `yaml` to parse and format output during read operations.

## Templating for write operations

- **Description:** Support templating languages for generating content with variables.
- **Implementation:** Add support for a templating engine (e.g., Jinja2) in the write tool with variable substitution.

## Version control integration

- **Description:** Automatically commit changes made by the write tool to Git.
- **Implementation:** Integrate with `libgit2` to perform commits after write operations with configurable commit messages.

## Diff-based editing

- **Description:** Allow applying diffs or patches for precise file modifications.
- **Implementation:** Add a diff parser to the edit tool to apply patch files or inline diffs.

## Merge conflict resolution

- **Description:** Assist in resolving merge conflicts by suggesting resolutions.
- **Implementation:** Use AI to analyze merge conflicts and propose resolutions via the edit tool.

## Code refactoring suggestions

- **Description:** Provide suggestions for refactoring, like renaming variables or extracting methods.
- **Implementation:** Integrate an AST parser to analyze code and suggest refactorings during edit operations.

## Interactive editing mode

- **Description:** Offer step-by-step AI-suggested changes for user approval.
- **Implementation:** Add an interactive CLI mode with prompts for accepting/rejecting changes.

## Undo/redo functionality

- **Description:** Keep a history of changes for undo/redo functionality.
- **Implementation:** Store changes in a session history and provide commands to undo/redo them.
