Within Gemini CLI, `packages/cli` is the frontend for users to send and receive prompts with the Gemini AI model and its associated tools. For a general overview of Gemini CLI, see the [main documentation page](../index.md).

## Interactive vs. Non-Interactive Modes

Gemini CLI supports two primary modes of operation to suit different workflows:

-   **Interactive Mode:** This is the default REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) experience, where you engage in a continuous conversation with the AI, receiving responses and issuing follow-up prompts. This mode is ideal for exploratory coding, debugging, and iterative problem-solving.

-   **Non-Interactive Mode:** This mode is designed for scripting, automation, and single-shot tasks. You provide input to the CLI (e.g., via piping or command-line flags), it executes the command, and then exits. This is useful for integrating Gemini CLI into automated scripts or CI/CD pipelines.

### Non-interactive mode

To run Gemini CLI in non-interactive mode, you can pipe input to the CLI or use the `--prompt` (or `-p`) flag. The CLI will execute the command and print the output to your terminal, then exit.

**Example: Piping a command to Gemini CLI**

```bash
echo "What is fine tuning?" | gemini
```

**Example: Using the `--prompt` flag**

```bash
gemini -p "What is fine tuning?"
```
