## Authentication Setup

The Gemini CLI requires you to authenticate with Google's AI services. On initial startup you'll need to configure **one** of the following authentication methods:

1.  **Login with Google (Gemini Code Assist):**

    - Use this option to log in with your google account.
    - During initial startup, Gemini CLI will direct you to a webpage for authentication. Once authenticated, your credentials will be cached locally so the web login can be skipped on subsequent runs.
    - Note that the web login must be done in a browser that can communicate with the machine Gemini CLI is being run from. (Specifically, the browser will be redirected to a localhost url that Gemini CLI will be listening on).

      1. You have a Google Workspace account. Google Workspace is a paid service for businesses and organizations that provides a suite of productivity tools, including a custom email domain (e.g. your-name@your-company.com), enhanced security features, and administrative controls. These accounts are often managed by an employer or school.
      1. You have recieved a free Code Assist license through the [Google Developer Program](https://developers.google.com/program/plans-and-pricing) (including qualified Google Developer Experts)
      1. You have been assigned a license to a current Gemini Code Assist standard or enterprise subscription.
      1. You are using the product outside the the [supported regions](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/resources/available-locations) for free individual usage.>
      1. You are a Google account holder under the age of 18

      - If you fall into one of these categories, you must first configure a Google Cloud Project Id to use, [enable the Gemini for Cloud API](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/discover/set-up-gemini#enable-api) and [configure access permissions](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/discover/set-up-gemini#grant-iam).

      You can temporarily set the environment variable in your current shell session using the following command:

      ```bash
      export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
      ```

      - For repeated use, you can add the environment variable to your `.env` file (located in the project directory or user home directory) or your shell's configuration file (like `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`). For example, the following command adds the environment variable to a `~/.bashrc` file:

      ```bash
      echo 'export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"' >> ~/.bashrc
      source ~/.bashrc
      ```

2.  **<a id="gemini-api-key"></a>Gemini API key:**

    - Obtain your API key from Google AI Studio: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
    - Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable. In the following methods, replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with the API key you obtained from Google AI Studio:
      - You can temporarily set the environment variable in your current shell session using the following command:
        ```bash
        export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```
      - For repeated use, you can add the environment variable to your `.env` file (located in the project directory or user home directory) or your shell's configuration file (like `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`). For example, the following command adds the environment variable to a `~/.bashrc` file:
        ```bash
        echo 'export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"' >> ~/.bashrc
        source ~/.bashrc
        ```

3.  **Vertex AI:**
    - If not using express mode:
      - Ensure you have a Google Cloud project and have enabled the Vertex AI API.
      - Set up Application Default Credentials (ADC), using the following command:
        ```bash
        gcloud auth application-default login
        ```
        For more information, see [Set up Application Default Credentials for Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).
      - Set the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`, and `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI` environment variables. In the following methods, replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` and `YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION` with the relevant values for your project:
        - You can temporarily set these environment variables in your current shell session using the following commands:
          ```bash
          export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
          export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION" # e.g., us-central1
          export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
          ```
        - For repeated use, you can add the environment variables to your `.env` file (located in the project directory or user home directory) or your shell's configuration file (like `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`). For example, the following commands add the environment variables to a `~/.bashrc` file:
          ```bash
          echo 'export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"' >> ~/.bashrc
          echo 'export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="YOUR_PROJECT_LOCATION"' >> ~/.bashrc
          echo 'export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true' >> ~/.bashrc
          source ~/.bashrc
          ```

## Voice Input Authentication (Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API)

The voice input feature in Gemini CLI utilizes the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API. To use this feature, you need to configure authentication with Google Cloud Platform.

### Prerequisites:

1.  **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project:**
    *   You must have an active GCP project.
    *   In your GCP project, ensure the **Speech-to-Text API is enabled**.
    *   Verify that **billing is enabled** for your project. While the Speech-to-Text API offers a free tier, usage beyond that will incur charges. Refer to the [official Speech-to-Text API pricing page](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/pricing) for details.

2.  **Service Account Key (Recommended):**
    *   Navigate to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts** in the GCP Console for your project.
    *   Create a new service account or select an existing one.
    *   Ensure the service account has the "**Speech-to-Text API User**" role (or a role that includes this permission, e.g., "Editor").
    *   Create a key for the service account (JSON format is recommended) and download the key file to a secure location.
    *   Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the absolute path of the downloaded JSON key file.
        ```bash
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/downloaded-keyfile.json"
        ```
        Gemini CLI (and other Google Cloud client libraries) will automatically use this environment variable to authenticate.
    *   **Important Security Note:** The service account key JSON file contains sensitive credentials. **Do not commit this file to your repository or share it insecurely.** Add its name or path to your `.gitignore` file.

### Usage Notes:

*   A stable internet connection is required to use the voice input feature.
*   Your operating system may prompt you for microphone access permission when the feature is first used.
*   The accuracy of speech recognition can be affected by microphone quality and ambient noise levels.
*   It is your responsibility to monitor your Speech-to-Text API usage and associated costs via the GCP Console.
    - If using express mode:
      - Set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable. In the following methods, replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your Vertex AI API key provided by express mode:
        - You can temporarily set these environment variables in your current shell session using the following commands:
          ```bash
          export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
          export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
          ```
        - For repeated use, you can add the environment variables to your `.env` file (located in the project directory or user home directory) or your shell's configuration file (like `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`). For example, the following commands add the environment variables to a `~/.bashrc` file:
          ```bash
          echo 'export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"' >> ~/.bashrc
          echo 'export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true' >> ~/.bashrc
          source ~/.bashrc
          ```
