### Summary

All critical and high-priority comments from PR #17 have been verified and confirmed as resolved:

## 1. Category Type Mismatch (Critical) ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Mismatch between directory structure `policies/` and type definition `'policy'`
- **Status**: Already fixed - interface correctly uses `'policies'` (plural) in `prompt-assembly.ts:22`
- **Verification**: Both interface and implementation use consistent plural form

## 2. ValidationSuite Error Handling (High) ✅ RESOLVED  
- **Issue**: `loadAllModules` returning empty array instead of failing loudly
- **Status**: Already fixed - method throws descriptive errors in `ValidationSuite.ts:446-451`
- **Verification**: Proper error propagation implemented

## 3. AssemblyResult Interface Usage (High) ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Test files using incorrect properties (`success`, `content`, `metadata.modulesLoaded`)
- **Status**: Already fixed - all test files use correct interface properties
- **Verification**: 
  - `live-integration-test.ts`: Uses `basicResult.prompt`, `basicResult.totalTokens`, `basicResult.includedModules.length`
  - `integration-test.ts`: Uses `result.includedModules.length`, `result.totalTokens`
  - `ModuleValidator.test.ts`: Mock returns use correct properties
