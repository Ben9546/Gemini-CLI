Introduced a new centralized logging utility ()
to provide consistent and colorized logging across the Gemini CLI.

Integrated this new logger into the following core modules and tools:
- : Replaced internal logging with the new utility.
- : Updated to export the new logger.
- : Enhanced with new logger calls and  blocks.
- : Integrated logger for better tracing and error reporting.
- : Added logger calls and  for file operations.
- : Enhanced with logger and error handling for file writes.
- : Integrated logger for validation, calculation, and execution.
- : Added logger for directory listing operations.
- : Integrated logger for file globbing.
- : Added logger for file content searching.
- : Enhanced with logger for web content fetching.

These changes improve the observability and robustness of the CLI by providing
detailed and consistent logging, and better error handling across critical operations.
