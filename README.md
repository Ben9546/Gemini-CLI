# Gemini-Cli

**A Command-Line Interface for Google Gemini Models**

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Description

Gemini-Cli is a command-line tool that allows you to easily interact with Google's Gemini family of models directly from your terminal. It provides a simple and efficient way to send prompts and receive responses from Gemini for various tasks, such as text generation, code completion, translation, and more.

## Features

- **Text Generation:** Generate creative text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, emails, letters, etc., based on your prompts.
- **Code Completion & Generation:** Get assistance with code snippets, function generation, and understanding code logic.
- **Translation:** Translate text from one language to another.
- **Question Answering:** Ask questions and receive informative answers.
- **Simple Command-Line Interface:** Easy to use and integrate into your workflows.
- **Configurable API Key:** Securely manage your Google Gemini API key.
- **Output Formatting:** Control the output format of Gemini's responses.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Install using pip

```bash
pip install gemini-cli  # Or the actual package name if different
```

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mentallyspammed1/Gemini-Cli.git
cd Gemini-Cli  # Navigate to the cloned directory
pip install .
```

## Configuration

Gemini-Cli requires a Google Gemini API key to function. Obtain an API key from the [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) (or the relevant Google Cloud AI platform).

### Set API Key as Environment Variable (Recommended)

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your actual API key. Add this line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) for persistent access.

### Pass API Key Directly (Less Secure)

```bash
gemini --api-key YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY "Your prompt here"
```

**Warning:** Storing your API key directly in commands is less secure and not recommended for regular use.

## Usage

### Basic Prompting

```bash
gemini "Write a short poem about the moon."
```

### More Detailed Prompts

```bash
gemini "Translate 'Hello, world!' to French and Spanish."
```

### Code Generation

```bash
gemini "Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number."
```

### Using Options

```bash
gemini --model gemini-pro --max-tokens 100 "Summarize the plot of Hamlet in three sentences."
```

### Common Options

- `--model <model_name>`: Specify the Gemini model to use (e.g., `gemini-pro`, `gemini-ultra` - if supported).
- `--api-key <your_api_key>`: Pass the API key directly (less secure, see Configuration).
- `--max-tokens <number>`: Set the maximum number of tokens in the response.
- `--temperature <value>`: Control the randomness of the output (0.0 for deterministic, 1.0 for more random).
- `--output-format <format>`: Specify the output format (e.g., `text`, `json`, `markdown`).
- `--help` or `-h`: Show help information and available options.

### Examples

- **Generate a story:**
  ```bash
  gemini "Write a short story about a robot learning to feel emotions."
  ```

- **Get code help:**
  ```bash
  gemini "How do I use list comprehensions in Python?"
  ```

- **Translate text and save to a file:**
  ```bash
  gemini "Translate this paragraph to German: [Paste your paragraph here]" > translated_german.txt
  ```
