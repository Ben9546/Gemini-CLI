- [x] Complete --provider flag implementation in main function (users can now use --provider copilot|gemini|google|vertex)
- [x] Changed banner/branding to "Gemini Copilot" throughout the UI
- [x] Created setup wizard for first-time Copilot users with VSCode/extension checks
- [x] Added health check on startup for VSCode bridge with warnings
- [x] Updated ASCII art to show "GEMINI COPILOT"
- [x] Added /model command for switching between available models
- [x] Implemented bridge extension installation instructions
- [x] Fixed model switching to read dynamically from config instead of caching
- [x] Added JSON response cleaning for markdown code blocks
- [x] Implemented HTTP streaming with Server-Sent Events for chat responses

### ‚è≥ Milestone 5: Testing and Quality Assurance (Week 7) - NOT STARTED
**Status**: 0% Complete

#### TODO:
- [ ] Unit tests for all new components
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Compatibility testing across platforms

### ‚è≥ Milestone 6: Documentation and Release (Week 8) - NOT STARTED
**Status**: 0% Complete

#### TODO:
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] Developer documentation
- [ ] VSCode extension marketplace preparation
- [ ] npm package publication

## Current Focus
Milestone 4 (CLI Integration and Configuration) is now complete! The provider system is fully implemented and integrated with the following key features:
- Copilot as default provider for gemini-copilot binary
- Opt-in fallback behavior (via settings, env var, or CLI flag)
- --provider CLI flag for runtime provider selection
- Setup wizard for first-time Copilot users
- Health checks for VSCode bridge
- Updated branding to "Gemini Copilot"

Next focus: Milestone 5 (Testing and Quality Assurance) - comprehensive testing of all new features.

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Architecture**: Clean provider abstraction with factory pattern
2. **Communication**: HTTP + WebSocket bridge between CLI and VSCode
3. **Default Port**: 7337 for bridge server
4. **Error Handling**: Opt-in fallback to Gemini (disabled by default for enterprise security)
5. **Testing**: Maintaining high test coverage (90%+ target)
6. **Fallback Behavior**: Three ways to enable - settings file, environment variable, or CLI flag
7. **Provider Selection**: Default based on binary name (gemini-copilot uses Copilot)

## Known Issues
- VSCode API types need careful handling (LanguageModelChat vs LanguageModelChatModel)
- TypeScript compilation requires DOM lib and skipLibCheck for VSCode extension

## Next Steps
1. Complete --provider flag implementation in main function
2. Test end-to-end flow with actual VSCode bridge
3. Create setup wizard for first-time Copilot users
4. Update help text and documentation
5. Add health check on startup for VSCode bridge
6. Begin comprehensive testing phase (Milestone 5)
