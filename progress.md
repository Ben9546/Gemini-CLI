- [x] Created provider factory implementation with fallback support
- [x] Defined types for chat requests/responses
- [x] Implemented CopilotProvider with full functionality
- [x] Implemented GeminiProvider by refactoring existing code
- [x] Created comprehensive tests for all providers (types, factory, copilot, gemini)
- [x] Added necessary dependencies (axios for HTTP, ws for WebSocket)
- [x] Implemented streaming support for both providers
- [x] Added provider exports and index file

### ‚è≥ Milestone 4: CLI Integration and Configuration (Week 6) - NOT STARTED
**Status**: 0% Complete

#### TODO:
- [ ] Update CLI configuration to use Copilot as default
- [ ] Modify authentication flow
- [ ] Add --provider flag
- [ ] Create setup wizard
- [ ] Update help text

### ‚è≥ Milestone 5: Testing and Quality Assurance (Week 7) - NOT STARTED
**Status**: 0% Complete

#### TODO:
- [ ] Unit tests for all new components
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Compatibility testing across platforms

### ‚è≥ Milestone 6: Documentation and Release (Week 8) - NOT STARTED

#### TODO:
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] Developer documentation
- [ ] VSCode extension marketplace preparation
- [ ] npm package publication

## Current Focus
Working on refactoring the existing Gemini code into the GeminiProvider to complete the provider abstraction layer. Next steps include integrating the provider factory into the CLI.

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Architecture**: Clean provider abstraction with factory pattern
2. **Communication**: HTTP + WebSocket bridge between CLI and VSCode
3. **Default Port**: 7337 for bridge server
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to Gemini when Copilot unavailable
5. **Testing**: Maintaining high test coverage (90%+ target)

## Known Issues
- VSCode API types need careful handling (LanguageModelChat vs LanguageModelChatModel)
- TypeScript compilation requires DOM lib and skipLibCheck for VSCode extension

## Next Steps
1. Write tests for provider abstraction
2. Implement CopilotProvider
3. Refactor GeminiProvider
4. Test bridge connection between CLI and VSCode
