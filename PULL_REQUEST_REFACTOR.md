## refactor(ui): Remove duplicate ANSI theme definition

**Context:** This change addresses feedback received on a previous pull request (e.g., [google-gemini/gemini-cli#3003](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/3003)) regarding code duplication.

### Problem

The `ansiTheme` object defined in `packages/cli/src/ui/themes/theme.ts` was found to be nearly identical to the `ansiColors` object in `packages/cli/src/ui/themes/ansi.ts`. This duplication created a maintenance risk, as future updates to one theme definition might not be reflected in the other, leading to potential UI inconsistencies and bugs. Further investigation confirmed that the `ansiTheme` object in `theme.ts` was unused throughout the codebase.

### Solution

This commit resolves the duplication by removing the redundant and unused `ansiTheme` object from `packages/cli/src/ui/themes/theme.ts`. This simplifies the codebase, reduces the potential for inconsistencies, and improves overall maintainability.

### How to Test

To verify that this refactoring has not introduced any regressions:

1.  **Confirm Removal:** Verify that the `ansiTheme` object no longer exists in `packages/cli/src/ui/themes/theme.ts`.
2.  **Run Tests:** Execute the CLI package tests to ensure all existing tests still pass:
    ```bash
    npm run test:ci --workspace=packages/cli
    ```
    (Note: Existing, unrelated Windows path test failures are expected and not introduced by this change.)
3.  **Manual Verification:** Launch the CLI and manually switch to the `ANSI` theme. Confirm that the theme still applies correctly and that text visibility (especially black text on dark backgrounds) remains as expected after the previous fix.

#### Testing Matrix

This change is a refactoring and does not alter functionality. The primary verification is through automated tests and confirming no regressions in the `ANSI` theme's appearance.

| Test Aspect | Verification Method | Expected Outcome |
| :---------- | :------------------ | :--------------- |
| Code Removal | Manual inspection of `theme.ts` | `ansiTheme` object is absent |
| Functionality | `npm run test:ci` (packages/cli) | All tests (excluding known, unrelated failures) pass |
| UI Integrity | Manual CLI usage with ANSI theme | Theme functions as expected, no visual regressions |
