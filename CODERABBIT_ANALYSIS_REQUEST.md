# CodeRabbit Analysis Request

This PR contains the complete official Google Gemini CLI codebase for comprehensive analysis by CodeRabbit.

## Requested Analysis

@coderabbitai Please perform a comprehensive analysis of this entire codebase and provide:

### 1. Code Documentation
- Generate comprehensive JSDoc/docstrings for all functions, classes, methods, and components
- Focus on missing documentation in TypeScript, JavaScript, and React components
- Include parameter descriptions, return types, and usage examples
- **Priority**: All undocumented public APIs and complex functions

### 2. Test Generation
- Identify functions and components that lack test coverage
- Generate comprehensive unit tests for core functionality
- Create integration tests for critical workflows
- Focus on CLI commands, configuration handling, and core utilities
- **Priority**: Authentication, file operations, and command processing

### 3. Code Quality Review
- Identify potential bugs, security issues, and performance problems
- Review error handling and edge cases
- Check for proper TypeScript typing
- Identify code smells and refactoring opportunities

### 4. Architecture Analysis
- Review overall code organization and structure
- Identify potential improvements to modularity
- Check for proper separation of concerns
- Review dependency management

## Files of Special Interest

Please pay particular attention to:
- `/packages/cli/src/` - Core CLI functionality
- `/packages/core/src/` - Core utilities and shared code
- Configuration and authentication modules
- File operation and tool integration code

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Immediate**: Comprehensive code review with specific recommendations
2. **Generate**: Complete docstring/JSDoc coverage for the entire codebase
3. **Generate**: Unit and integration test suites for untested code
4. **Report**: Security and performance analysis summary

Please use your code generation capabilities to create the missing documentation and tests directly in this PR.
